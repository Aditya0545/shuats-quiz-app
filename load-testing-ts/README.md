# Load Testing Documentation for Quiz Application

Let's create a comprehensive documentation file for the load testing system:

```markdown:load-testing-ts/README.md
# Quiz Application Load Testing

This directory contains tools for load testing the Quiz Application to measure its performance under various levels of concurrent user load.

## Overview

The load testing suite consists of:

1. **Data Generation**: Creates test questions and user accounts
2. **Load Testing**: Simulates concurrent users accessing key API endpoints
3. **Results Visualization**: Generates charts and reports to analyze performance

## Prerequisites

Before running the load tests, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js 16+ installed
- MongoDB running and accessible
- Quiz application configured with proper environment variables
- Required dependencies installed:
  ```
  npm install autocannon chartjs-node-canvas
  ```

## Directory Structure

```

    ├── all-results.json  # Complete test results
    └── report.html       # HTML report with visualizations
```

## Test Phases

The load testing is conducted in phases with increasing concurrent connections:

| Phase | Connections | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | 50 | Initial baseline test |
| 2 | 100 | Low-medium load |
| 3 | 150 | Medium load |
| 4 | 200 | Medium-high load |
| 5 | 250 | High load |
| 6 | 300 | Very high load |
| 7 | 350 | Extreme load |
| 8 | 400 | Stress test |
| 9 | 450 | Near-maximum load |
| 10 | 500 | Maximum load |

## Endpoints Tested

The following API endpoints are tested:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/login` | POST | User authentication |
| `/api/questions` | GET | Retrieving quiz questions |
| `/api/submit-answer` | POST | Submitting individual answers |
| `/api/submit-quiz` | POST | Submitting complete quiz |

## Running the Tests

### 1. Add Scripts to package.json

First, add these scripts to your project's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "load-test:generate": "ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register load-testing-ts/data-generator.ts",
    "load-test:run": "ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register load-testing-ts/load-tester.ts",
    "load-test:visualize": "ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register load-testing-ts/results-visualizer.ts",
    "load-test": "ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register load-testing-ts/index.ts"
  }
}
```

### 2. Generate Test Data

This step creates 500 test questions and 500 test users in your database:

```bash
npm run load-test:generate
```

### 3. Run Load Tests

This runs the actual load tests against your API endpoints:

```bash
npm run load-test:run
```

### 4. Visualize Results

This generates charts and an HTML report from the test results:

```bash
npm run load-test:visualize
```

### 5. Run All Steps

Alternatively, run all steps in sequence:

```bash
npm run load-test
```

## Understanding the Results

After running the tests, you'll find these key metrics in the results:

### Latency

- **Average**: The average response time in milliseconds
- **Min/Max**: The minimum and maximum response times
- **p50/p90/p99**: Response times at the 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles

### Throughput

- **Requests/sec**: How many requests the system can handle per second

### Error Rates

- **Errors**: Number of connection errors
- **Timeouts**: Number of request timeouts
- **Non-2xx**: Number of non-successful HTTP responses

## Interpreting the Charts

The generated charts help visualize how the application performs as load increases:

1. **Latency Chart**: Shows how response times change with increasing connections
2. **Throughput Chart**: Shows how many requests per second the system can handle
3. **Error Rate Chart**: Shows the percentage of failed requests

## Best Practices

- Run tests during off-peak hours to avoid affecting real users
- Ensure your database has sufficient test data before running tests
- Run tests multiple times to get consistent results
- Start with lower connection counts and gradually increase

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - Check if your application is running
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Ensure port settings are correct

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - Increase Node.js memory limit: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096`
   - Run tests in smaller batches

3. **Database Errors**:
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Ensure indexes are properly set up for performance

## Extending the Tests

To add new endpoints to test:

1. Add the endpoint to the `ENDPOINTS` array in `load-tester.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const ENDPOINTS = [
     // Existing endpoints...
     { name: 'newEndpoint', path: '/api/new-endpoint', method: 'POST' }
   ];
   ```

2. Create the corresponding API route in your application

## Conclusion

This load testing suite provides valuable insights into how your Quiz Application performs under various levels of concurrent user load. By analyzing the results, you can identify performance bottlenecks and make informed decisions about scaling and optimization.
